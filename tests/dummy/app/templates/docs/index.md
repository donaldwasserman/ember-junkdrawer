# Why does this exist?

This addon is a collection of helpful items in our programming junk-drawer. A helpful bunch of components divided into 
two parts: 
- Bootstrap "Extras" 
- UI Utilities 

The Bootstrap extras are things the [Ember Bootstrap](www.emberbootstrap.com) doesn't include or are combinations of a 
few existing components from there.

The UI utilities are a few base classes for making forms (using bs-form) and tables (using [Ember Light Table](https://github.com/offirgolan/ember-light-table))
more DRY and easier to use at scale.
