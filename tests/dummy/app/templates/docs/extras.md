# Assorted Bootstrap Extras

Just like in Grandma's junkdrawer, there are all sorts of questionable goodies in here. 


### Close Button

You can easily create a close button with a contextual action right here. 

{{docs-snippet name='close-button-usage.hbs' title='close-button-usage.hbs'}}
{{docs-snippet name='close-button-usage.js' title='close-button-usage.js'}}

### List Group

Make list groups with ease using contextual components

{{docs-snippet name='list-group-example.hbs' title='list-group-example.hbs'}}
